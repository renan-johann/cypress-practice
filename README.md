### Goals:

- [ x ] **Implement a Cypress test suite with TypeScript** to create clear, maintainable code, starting with the automation of 4 functional web tests as examples
- [ x ] **Build a Dockerfile** to run Cypress tests in isolated containers
- [ X ] **Create a comprehensive Docker Compose setup** that includes MinIO, MongoDB, Sorry Cypress API, Director, and Dashboard
- [ x ] **Generate real-time dashboards** using Sorry Cypress for detailed test reporting
- [ X ] **Integrate Slack with incoming webhooks** to receive real-time feedback loops notifications
- [ ] **Implement Vault** for secure management of secrets in your tests
- [ x ] **Automate Slack notifications** through Jenkins pipelines for enhanced CI/CD workflows
- [ ] **Set up an initial CI pipeline with GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and testing
- [ ] **Implement API functional testing** to extend test coverage to backend services
- [ ] **Implement performance testing** with Cypress to ensure optimal user experience under load
- [ ] **Establish parallel test execution** in CI pipeline to improve feedback loops
- [ ] **Integrate code quality checks** (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) to ensure best practices in all test scripts
- [ ] **Track and improve test coverage** using Istanbul (nyc)
- [ ] **Create reusable custom Cypress commands** for cleaner and more efficient tests
- [ ] **Create and configure CI pipelines** to run tests across multiple environments (development, staging, production), using environment-specific variables and settings to ensure accurate testing in each stage.

### Below the project structure

**Cypress-practice**

- _cypress_
  - _page-objects_
  - _e2e_
    - _specs_

### Pre-configure

**Add into /etc/hosts**
`127.0.0.1 storage`

### Config to Run scripts

**Docker:**

Run `docker compose up`
Acessar o sorry-cypress-dashboard: <http://localhost/80>

**Jenkins:**
open a browser on <http://localhost:8080>

### Start-server-and-test module

If the server takes a very long time to start, we recommend trying the [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test) module.


### Running sorry-cypress kit

We are going to run the full sorry-cypress kit:
1. **director** service will use MongoDB to store the test runs and the results
2. **API** service (a GraphQL interface to MongoDB) to let us issue queries and retrieve tests results
3. **Dashboard** service - a web dashboard for browsing the results
4. **minio** will let us store files - videos and screenshots generated by cypress agent

### After successfully running docker-compose, we have:

**Director** service on <http://localhost:1234>
**API** service on <http://localhost:4000>
**Dashboard** running on <http://localhost:8080>
